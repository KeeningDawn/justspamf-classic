# Just Spam F (Classic)

Allows you to press "F" for most (if not all) dialog buttons.

This mod is built for patch 31. It *may* work on patch 29, but you'll likely need a custom S_DIALOG definition file compatible with that version.

## Installation

Click the green "Code" button, then select "Download ZIP".

Move the inner folder into your Toolbox `mods` folder.

## Commands

| Command |  Description                |
| :------ |  :------------------------- |
| `!jsf` or `/8 jsf` | Toggles the mod. **Enabled** by default. |
